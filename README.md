# Waffle.io

## Introduction

Waffle.io is an advanced activity tracker for GitHub. It was created in 2003 by a group of interns at Rally Software, right here in Boulder. Waffle helps development teams track GitHub tasks, issues, and user stories by using a streamlined GUI and command line interface. Throughout this presentation, we will observe Waffle's abundant features by working through an example project. 

## Set-Up

	1) If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account. You will only need the basic free plan to work throughout this tutorial. 
	2) Visit (https://waffle.io/) and sign up by choosing "Public Repos" and logging in through your GitHub credentials. 
		- This will allow Waffle to gain read/write accss to your public repositories on GitHub.
	3) Create a new public GitHub repo:
