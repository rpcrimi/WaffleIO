# Waffle.io

## Introduction

Waffle.io is an advanced activity tracker for GitHub. It was created in 2003 by a group of interns at Rally Software, right here in Boulder. Waffle helps development teams track GitHub tasks, issues, and user stories by using a streamlined GUI and command line interface. Throughout this presentation, we will observe Waffle's abundant features by working through an example project.
