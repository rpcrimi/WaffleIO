# Conclusion

Waffle is a fantastic tool for agile development teams that are already using GitHub. It enables development teams to easily manage and track stories and issues throughout the development process. It also enables teams to continuously deliver improved products to customers. 

I use Waffle for my school and personal projects. I find that Waffle makes issues and tasks I need to address become much more evident. It is very simple to drop an issue or task right into Waffle, enabling it to be tracked. My time is not wasted dealing with non-intuitive UI's and dependencies as other issue trackers have, such as Pivital Tracker. As I move issues from "In-Progress" to "Done", I can easily move new tasks into the "In-Progress" queue. This ensures that I will have a constant flow of tasks to work on. Furthermore, I can track my metrics through Waffle's UI. From these metrics, I can view how my current iteration stacks up against the past. Using Waffle over the past year, I have seen my productivity and efficiency improve dramatically. With Waffle, I find myself finishing projects well ahead of schedule, allowing me to work on other tasks at hand.
