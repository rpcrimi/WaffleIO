# Conclusion

Overall, Waffle is a fantastic tool for agile development teams using GitHub. It allows development teams to easily manage and track stories and issues throughout the development process. 

Personally, I use Waffle for my school and personal projects. I find that when I am working on such projects, issues and tasks become evident during development. It is very simple to drop this issue or task right into Waffle so that it can be tracked. My time is not wasted dealing with non-intuitive UI's and dependancies as other issue trackers have. As I move issues from "In-Progress" to "Done", I can easily move new tasks into the "In-Progress" queue. This ensures that I will have a constant flow of tasks to work on. Furthermore, I can track my metrics through Waffle's UI. From these metrics, I can view how my current iteration stacks up against the past. Using Waffle over the past year, I have seen my productivity and efficiency improve drastically.
