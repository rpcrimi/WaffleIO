# Conclusion

Overall, Waffle is a fantastic tool for agile development teams using GitHub. It allows development teams to easily manage and track stories and issues throughout the development process. 

Personally, I use Waffle for my school and personal projects. I find that when I am working on such projects, issues and tasks become evident during development. It is very simple to drop this issue or task right into Waffle so that it can be tracked. My time is not wasted dealing with non-intuitive UI's and dependancies as other issue trackers have.
