# Adding Stories and Issues

Lets add a new story to our Kanban board. 

- Click on the "Add Issue" button at the top of the screen. This will bring up the following box:
![Add Story](/images/w_add_story.png?raw=true "Add Story")
- Fill out the dialog and mark this issue as an "enhancement". 

- The story will appear in the "Backlog" column, which contains all of the stories not yet worked on for your project:
![Story In Backlog](/images/w_story_backlog.png?raw=true "Story In Backlog")

- The story will also appear in the issues section of your GitHub repo:
![Story In GitHub](/images/gh_story_in_issues.png?raw=true "Story In GitHub")

- You can assign the story points as follows:
![Assign Points](/images/w_assign_points.png?raw=true "Assign Points")
	- Story points are a measure of how much time a story will take to complete. 
	- Story points are typically measured in hours.
- Lets move this story into the "Ready" column. To do so, click and drag the story over into the "Ready" column. The "Ready" column contains stories that are ready to be worked on during the current iteration.
- You can assign this story to a user as follows:
![Assign Story](/images/w_assign_story.png?raw=true "Assign Story")

You are now ready to start working on your issues.
