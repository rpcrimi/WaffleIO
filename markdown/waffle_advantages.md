# Waffle Advantages

Waffle's main advantage over similar online software is how easy it is to use. Waffle has far less features compared to software systems such as Pivital Tracker and Jira; However, while this may sound disadvantageous, it is very useful for certain development teams. If teams can deal with the trade-offs between features and ease-of-use, Waffle is a perfect software system for them. 

## Dependencies
Development teams do not need to worry about setting up their infrastructure and installing dependencies. Teams can simply create a new GitHub repository and then integrate it with Waffle. Terminal commands are also much easier to use as they are slight modifications of git commands. Since git is the most popular open-source subversioning system, most developers are already familiar with these commands, which lessens the learning-curve.

## User Interface
Waffle's user interface is easier to use than similar products. For example, lets take a look at an exmaple Pivital Tracker project:
![Pivital Tracker](/images/pivitaltracker.png?raw=true "Pivital Tracker")
While Pivital Tracker has slightly more features, their user interface can be hard to navigate. Tasks can become cluttered on the screen which make navigation more difficult. Also, Pivital Tracker's git integration is also harder to set-up and use. Developers need to use special Pivital commands in order to keep track of stories and issues, which increases the learning-curve.

## Metrics
While Waffle's metrics features are not as abundant as Pivital Tracker's and similar software systems, it does have the advantage of simplicity. We can see this in the following two examples:
### Waffle Metric
![Waffle Metrics](/images/w_metrics.png?raw=true "Waffle Metrics")
### Pivital Tracker Metric
![Pivital Metrics](/images/pivital_metric.png?raw=true "Pivital Metrics")
While Pivital supplies teams with more metrics, Waffle's metrics are easier to parse. This can make it easier for novice teams to understand their efficiency and velocity.
