## Set-Up

In this section, we will focus on setting up a new Waffle project and integrating the project with GitHub.

1. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account. You will only need the basic plan to work through this tutorial. 
	- If you do not know how to use GitHub, read this quick tutorial: [GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
2. Visit (https://waffle.io/) and sign up by choosing "Public Repos" and logging in through your GitHub credentials. 
	- This will allow Waffle to gain read/write accss to your public repositories on GitHub.
3. Create a new public GitHub repo:

4. Add a new board to Waffle:

5. Select your new GitHub repo in the list of available repos. If you do not see the new repo, type the name into the search bar.
6. Click "Lets Go" to confirm you would like to start working with Waffle
7. You are now ready to start working with Waffle!
