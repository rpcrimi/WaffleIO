# Getting To Know Waffle

After going through the previous steps, you should be viewing the following board:

## Basic Features
- At the top of the screen you should see a menu with your new Waffle board selected. From this menu, you can easily navigate to other boards. This allows users to switch between multiple projects or branches quickly.

- Next to this menu is a button to add an issue. We will talk about this feature in the next section. 

- The top right of the screen is a search bar to filter through your Waffle board.

- Located down the left hand side of the board are ways to navigate to different parts of your Waffle board, including inviting others, settings, and metrics.

## Kanban
Now focus your attention to the 4 columns on the screen. 
- Waffle acts as a dynamic Kanban board. A Kanban board is a lightweight tool to allow developers in agile life-cycles continuously move stories and issues throughout production processes. The Kanban development approach

These boards are usually written on a physical board as we observe below:

	- When a team has decided to add a story, they write it down on a note and post it in the "To Do" column.
	- When the team is ready to work on this story, they can move it into the "Doing" column.
	- When the team is finished with the story, they move the note into the "Done" column.
	- This style of monitoring allows teams to continuously move stories and issues throughout the development life-cycle.

- Waffle acts as a digital Kanban board. The default columns for Waffle's Kanban board are labeled "Backlog", "Ready", "In-Progress", and "Done". These columns can be modified in "Settings". For example, a team could delete the "Ready" column if they deem it unnecessary. Teams can add stories and issues through the "Add Issue" button which will add a new note to the first column of the board ("Backlog").
