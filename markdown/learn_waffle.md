# Getting To Know Waffle

## Basic Features
- At the top of the screen you should see a menu with your new Waffle board selected. From this menu, you can easily navigate to other boards. This allows you to switch between multiple projects or branches quickly.

- Next to this menu is a button for adding an issue. We will talk about this feature in the next section. 

- At the top right of the screen is a search bar that enables you to filter your Waffle board by keywords and tags.

- Located down the left hand side of the board are features in your Waffle board, including inviting others, settings, and metrics.

- Waffle acts as a digital Kanban board. The default columns for Waffle's board are labeled "Backlog", "Ready", "In-Progress", and "Done". These columns can be modified in "Settings". For example, a team can delete the "Ready" column if it deems it unnecessary. It can also add columns to its Waffle board. For example, it is customary for agile teams to have a review process in which it ensures that the code being committed is sufficiently bug-free. A team following this custom can add an "In-Review" column that enables developers to note which stories are available for review. 

- Teams can add stories and issues through the "Add Issue" button which adds a new note to the first column of the board ("Backlog").
