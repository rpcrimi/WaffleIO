# Getting To Know Waffle

After going through the previous steps, you should be viewing the following board:

## Basic Features
- At the top of the screen you should see a menu with your new Waffle board selected. From this menu, you can easily navigate to other boards. This allows users to switch between multiple projects or branches quickly.

- Next to this menu is a button to add an issue. We will talk about this feature in the next section. 

- The top right of the screen is a search bar to filter through your Waffle board.

- Located down the left hand side of the board are ways to navigate to different parts of your Waffle board, including inviting others, settings, and metrics.

- Waffle acts as a digital Kanban board. The default columns for Waffle's board are labeled "Backlog", "Ready", "In-Progress", and "Done". These columns can be modified in "Settings". For example, a team could delete the "Ready" column if they deem it unnecessary. Teams can also add columns to their Waffle board. For example, it is customary for agile teams to have a "Review" process in which they ensure that the code being committed is sufficiently bug-free. A team following this custom can add an "In-Review" column to allow developers to note which stories are available to be reviewed. 

- Teams can add stories and issues through the "Add Issue" button which will add a new note to the first column of the board ("Backlog").
