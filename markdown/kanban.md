# Kanban

Kanban is an approach to software development where teams focus on continuous delivery. Kanban is an agile life-cycle used when teams need to react to ever changing requirements from customers.

Waffle is focused around a Kanban development life-cycle and acts as a dynamic Kanban board. A Kanban board is a tool to allow developers in agile life-cycles continuously move stories and issues throughout production processes. These boards are usually written on a physical board as we observe below:

- When a team has decided to add a story, they write it down on a note and post it in the "To Do" column.
- When the team is ready to work on this story, they can move it into the "Doing" column.
- When the team is finished with the story, they move the note into the "Done" column.

This style of monitoring allows teams to continuously move stories and issues throughout the development life-cycle.
