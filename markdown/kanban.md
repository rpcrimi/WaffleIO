Kanban is an approach to software development where teams focus on continuous delivery. It is an agile life-cycle used when teams need to react to ever changing requirements from customers. 

Originally developed by Toyota in 1953, Kanban was developed as a production technique to meet the ever changing demand for their products. A research team at Toyota studied how supermarkets efficiently stocked their shelves and realized that the supermarkets would stock only the supply of items that they expected customers would demand at a given time. For example, when the demand for a product decreased, so would the supply of that product. Toyota inherited this technique to their production floor. Let's image a production crew consisting of three teams: A, B, and C. Team A feeds their work to B and likewise from B to C. If team B became overwhelmed with work, Kanban would allow team A to stop production and move to something else. Furthermore, since team C would see a decrease in incoming work, they could focus their attention on something else. When team B is back on track, teams A and C can start working on their original tasks. 

This style of production allows for products to leave the facility in a continuous stream. A particular team can never be blocked waiting for another team to finish work. If such a block occurs, the blocked team simply switches their focus to another task, thus ensuring continuous production.

## Kanban Development
Kanban development emerged from Toyota's production technique.  

Waffle is focused around a Kanban development life-cycle and acts as a dynamic Kanban board. A Kanban board is a tool to allow developers in agile life-cycles continuously move stories and issues throughout production processes. These boards are usually written on a physical board as we observe below:

- When a team has decided to add a story, they write it down on a note and post it in the "To Do" column.
- When the team is ready to work on this story, they can move it into the "Doing" column.
- When the team is finished with the story, they move the note into the "Done" column.

This style of monitoring allows teams to continuously move stories and issues throughout the development life-cycle.
